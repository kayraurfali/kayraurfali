## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Actively contributing on the custom built game engine, [Glist Engine](https://github.com/GlistEngine/GlistEngine), on every aspect as much as I can.

#### Also working on my own custom built game engine, [NdiEngine](https://github.com/NdiGames/NdiEngine), which is just a beginner project at the moment. But I'll be constantly developing it and also learning things along the way with it. Anyone who wants to learn OpenGL or who just wants to help developing it, can contribute to the project via Pull Requests. I'll be happy for any help I get!
